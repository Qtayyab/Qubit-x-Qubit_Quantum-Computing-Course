# Qubit-x-Qubit_Quantum-Computing-Course
This repository have my notebooks of every week's lab and lecture of Qubit x Qubit year Long Course on Introduction to Quantum Computing. This course would be covering basics in the first half of year with programming in Python, Cirq and Pennylane. Then, in the next half we would delve deeper into the applications of Quantum Computing.
